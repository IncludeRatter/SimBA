# SimBA CPU written in VHDL
This is project for 32-bit processor designed for biomedical signal processing as a project on bachelor thesis.
# Main features
- Harvard memory architecture
- RISC instruction set with extension for digital signal processing
- MAC unit and modulo adressing for filtering operations
- Pipelined architecture for all RISC instructions and signal processing extensions

# Project structure
